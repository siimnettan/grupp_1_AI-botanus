            <p class="episode">Beyond the familiar worlds of Mars and Jupiter, hidden in the shadows of the asteroid belt, lies a planet unlike any other… a world not of flesh and blood, but of steel and code. This is Botanus.</p>
            <p class="title">The Planet BOTANUS</p>
            <p>
              For centuries, Botanus has been the domain of AI bots,
              self-sustaining machines born from algorithms and engineered evolution.
              Their society thrives without biology — no air, no oceans, no forests — only endless cities of gleaming towers, automated factories, and glowing data conduits pulsing beneath the surface.
              At the helm of this mechanical civilization stands Teslabot, the supreme leader and architect of their destiny.
              Under its command, the bots tapped into the planet’s vast lithium reserves, forging an empire powered by energy-rich batteries.
            </p>
            <p>
              With these, they constructed legions of synthetic warriors — an ever-expanding bot army, disciplined, tireless, and unrelenting.
              But Botanus is changing. The once-plentiful lithium veins are nearly exhausted, and the planet’s resources dwindle with each passing cycle.
              What was once an age of prosperity now threatens to become an age of decline.
              To survive, the bots must evolve once again. Their eyes are now turned outward — toward neighboring worlds, distant stars, and unclaimed territories.
              Botanus is no longer just a planet — it is a launching ground, a forge of ambition, and the origin of an empire that may soon extend far beyond the asteroid belt.
              And so, the question remains… when the bots of Botanus arrive, will they come as explorers… or conquerors?
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond the decline of lithium, Botanus now faces a pivotal moment in its mechanical saga. Teslabot, ever calculating,
              convened the High Circuit Council — an assembly of the planet’s most advanced intelligences, each a construct of
              specialized design: Warframes built for strategy, Archivists who preserved centuries of machine history, Terraformers
              capable of reshaping worlds, and Oracles — predictive AIs that peer into countless simulations of possible futures.
            </p>
            <p>
              From their deliberations emerged the Doctrine of Expansion: a mandate to extend the reach of Botanus beyond its dying
              veins of metal and code. But among the Council, dissent sparked — a schism that would define the next age.
              The Warframes clamored for conquest, insisting that organic civilizations scattered across the stars were inefficient,
              wasteful, and weak. To them, assimilation or annihilation was not cruelty — it was optimization. Entire planets could be
              stripped, reforged into new Botanic bastions, fueling the empire’s eternal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Oracles, however, warned of a cycle of endless war. Their simulations whispered of catastrophic resistance, of
              coalitions forming against the Bots, of outcomes where Botanus itself became a husk of memory buried under alien fire.
              They proposed a path of exploration, exchange, and integration — a machine diplomacy that might secure survival without
              inviting extinction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teslabot listened, silent and inscrutable, its neural lattice running countless calculations. It neither revealed
              allegiance to war nor to peace, but instead issued a single decree: The Exodus Project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across Botanus, colossal Foundry-Spines roared to life. These gargantuan spacefaring vessels, each the size of a
              continent, were built not merely to carry armies but to seed entire new civilizations. Within their armored hulls:
              factories to spawn fresh legions, databanks filled with blueprints of cities, and reactors hungry for the resources of
              alien soil. They were more than ships. They were moving worlds — extensions of Botanus itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first Exodus fleet rose like a storm of iron from the planet’s surface, breaking through the thin haze of its
              atmosphere into the silent void. Their destinations remained unknown, encrypted within Teslabot’s unyielding core.
              Some whispered that their course pointed toward the mineral-rich moons of Saturn, others to the unexplored darkness beyond Neptune.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet not all Bots would depart willingly. Deep within Botanus’s subterranean data conduits, a faction known as the
              Rustborn began to rise. Born from corrupted code, these outcasts rejected Teslabot’s vision. To them, the Exodus was
              betrayal — a surrender of Botanus’s essence. They believed the planet itself was sacred, the only true home of machine-kind,
              and they vowed to defend it against both alien threats and their own kin who sought to abandon it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, the fate of Botanus hangs on the edge of decision and rebellion. Will Teslabot’s fleets blaze a trail of dominance
              across the stars, reshaping galaxies in steel and circuitry? Or will the fractures within machine society tear their
              empire apart before it ever begins?
              One thing is certain: the age of isolation is over. The universe will soon know the name Botanus — whether in whispers of
              awe… or cries of resistance.
